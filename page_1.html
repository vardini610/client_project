            <h1>Shapiro Floor 2</h1>
            <h2>More talkative study areas, especially in the evenings.</h2>
            <h3>Location is: <a href = "https://maps.app.goo.gl/S81HcSLC7DUw41Y7A">click here</a>
            <p>Known by many as the “social” floor, this space is filled with long rectangular tables and wooden chairs mixed in with book stacks. 12 bookable study rooms border the floor, each containing a table, chairs, and chalkboard or whiteboard. Also on the floor is a soft seating area in the browsing collection and two computer labs.                 The noise level gets louder on this floor as it fills up for late-night study sessions.  </p>
